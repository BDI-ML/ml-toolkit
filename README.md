# ml-toolkit
This package is for me to have a central and standardized library for designing experiments and collecting data.

# Installation
1. create a virtual environment using python 3.10
2. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project root directory
3. execute the code by calling `python -m ml_toolkit`
	- run with `--help` to see your options
4. (optional) run `pip install -e .` in the project root directory
	- this allows you to execute the code by just calling `mltoolkit` when your virtual environment is enabled

# Configuration Files
Browse the [configuration files directory](./cfg) to get an overview of the available models and how to train them
